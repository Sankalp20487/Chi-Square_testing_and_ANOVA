## Introduction
This report presents an analysis utilizing Chi-Square testing and ANOVA to investigate data across various domains, including medical research, airline performance, the movie industry, military personnel statistics, the food industry, and agricultural studies. The primary goal is to assess relationships, differences, and dependencies among variables in these domains.

## Methodology
The analysis comprises several tasks, each addressing specific research questions within the above-mentioned domains. Chi-Square tests of goodness-of-fit and independence are used to analyze categorical data, while ANOVA is applied to continuous data to identify mean differences across groups.

## Tasks Overview
- **Task 1**: Analysis of blood type distribution among hospital patients versus the general population.
- **Task 2**: Study of on-time performance by airlines.
- **Task 3**: Examination of movie admissions and ethnicity correlation.
- **Task 4**: Analysis of gender distribution in military ranks.
- **Task 5**: Sodium content comparison in foods.
- **Task 6**: Sales analysis for leading companies.
- **Task 7**: Educational expenditures per pupil across different regions.
- **Task 8**: Experiment on increasing plant growth with various factors.
- **Task 9**: Additional data analysis and reporting.

## Tools Used
- R Programming Language
- Relevant R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot, tibble

## Findings
The report provides detailed findings from each task, utilizing statistical evidence to confirm or refute the hypotheses tested. Notable findings include significant differences in airline on-time performance versus government statistics, ethnicityâ€™s effect on movie admissions, and the significant influence of food types on sodium content.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of statistical methods in drawing meaningful insights from data across diverse sectors. The Chi-Square testing and ANOVA methodologies have proven effective in identifying critical patterns and relationships within the datasets analyzed.
